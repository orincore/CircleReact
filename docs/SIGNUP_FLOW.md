# Fixed Signup Flow Documentation

## üéØ New Signup Flow (After Fix)

### **Step 1: User Registration**
- User completes signup form with all required information
- `signUp()` function called with user data
- `applyAuth()` called with `skipEmailVerification: true` to avoid interrupting signup
- `setIsNewSignup(true)` - Flags this as a new user signup
- Direct navigation to `/signup/summary` page

### **Step 2: Profile Summary & Completion**
- User reviews their profile information on summary page
- Profile picture upload and Instagram linking happens
- User sees welcome message and profile details
- "Let's Go!" button pressed

### **Step 3: Email Verification Check**
- Summary page checks if email verification is needed
- If email not verified: Navigate to `/auth/verify-email-post-signup`
- If email already verified: Navigate directly to `/secure/(tabs)/match`

### **Step 4: Post-Signup Email Verification** (if needed)
- Dedicated email verification page shown
- User enters OTP code received via email
- On successful verification:
  - `markEmailAsVerified()` called
  - Email verification status saved to AsyncStorage
  - Navigate directly to `/secure/(tabs)/match`
- Skip option available for later verification

### **Step 5: Match Page**
- User lands on the main matchmaking interface
- Full app functionality available
- Profile marked as completed for future logins

## üîÑ Returning User Flow

### **Login Process**
- User enters credentials
- `logIn()` function called
- `applyAuth()` called with `navigate: true`
- Directly redirected to `/secure/(tabs)/match`

### **Email Already Verified**
- `checkEmailVerification()` checks AsyncStorage first
- If `emailVerified: 'true'` found in storage:
  - Skip verification screen entirely
  - Navigate directly to appropriate page

## üõ°Ô∏è Persistence & Security

### **Email Verification Persistence**
- Status saved in AsyncStorage as `emailVerified: 'true'`
- Prevents re-verification on app restarts
- Cleared on logout for security

### **Profile Completion Tracking**
- `profileCompleted: true` saved to user profile
- Prevents showing summary page on future logins
- Ensures smooth returning user experience
