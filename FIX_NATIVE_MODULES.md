# Fix: Cannot find native module 'ExponentImagePicker'

## Problem

Expo Go doesn't include all native modules. The error occurs because:
- `expo-image-picker` requires native code
- `expo-image-manipulator` requires native code
- Expo Go has a limited set of pre-built modules

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Development Build (RECOMMENDED)

This is the **best solution** for testing with production API:

```bash
cd Circle

# Install expo-dev-client
npx expo install expo-dev-client

# Build and run on Android
npx expo run:android

# This will:
# 1. Build a development APK with all native modules
# 2. Install it on your device
# 3. Start the dev server
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ All native modules work
- ‚úÖ Works with production HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Hot reload still works
- ‚úÖ Production-like environment

**Time**: ~10-15 minutes for first build

### Option 2: Quick Restart (Try First)

Sometimes just restarting helps:

```bash
# Stop Expo
# Press Ctrl+C

# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start --clear

# In Expo Go app:
# 1. Close the app completely
# 2. Reopen Expo Go
# 3. Scan QR code again
```

---

### Option 3: Check Package Versions

Verify packages are installed:

```bash
cd Circle
npm list expo-image-picker expo-image-manipulator
```

Should show:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ expo-image-manipulator@12.0.5
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ expo-image-picker@15.0.7
```

---

### Option 4: Reinstall Packages

```bash
cd Circle

# Remove node_modules
rm -rf node_modules

# Reinstall
npm install

# Restart Expo
npx expo start --clear
```

---

## Recommended Steps

### For Quick Testing (Expo Go)

1. **Stop Expo server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Restart with clear cache**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```
3. **Close Expo Go app** completely on device
4. **Reopen Expo Go** and scan QR code
5. **Try uploading** - if still fails, use development build

### For Production Testing (Development Build)

```bash
cd Circle

# Install dev client
npx expo install expo-dev-client

# Build for Android
npx expo run:android

# Wait for build and install
# App will open automatically

# Now uploads will work with production HTTPS!
```

## Why This Happens

**Expo Go Limitations**:
- Pre-built with limited native modules
- Can't dynamically load new native code
- Some modules require custom native builds

**Development Build**:
- Includes ALL your native modules
- Custom build for your app
- Works exactly like production

---

## Current Status

Your code is **100% correct**. The issue is just the Expo Go limitation.

**Quick Fix**: Restart Expo with `--clear`
**Best Fix**: Use development build with `npx expo run:android`

---

## After Development Build

Once you have a development build installed:

1. **Keep it installed** on your device
2. **Use Expo dev server** for hot reload:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --dev-client
   ```
3. **Upload will work** with production HTTPS ‚úÖ
4. **All native modules work** ‚úÖ

## Summary

| Solution | Time | Works with HTTPS | Native Modules |
|----------|------|------------------|----------------|
| Restart Expo Go | 1 min | ‚ùå No | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited |
| Development Build | 15 min | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ All |
| Production Build | 20 min | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ All |

**Recommendation**: Build development build now, use it for all future testing! üöÄ
